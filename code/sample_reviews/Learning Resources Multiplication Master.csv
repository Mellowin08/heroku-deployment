It quit working 2 days after I received it.
"My daughter needs help learning math facts and we don't always have time to work with her. She was eager to try it out but soon lost interest. She doesn't like the timed feature; if you don't respond quickly it gives you the answer and moves on. Product does work as it should, she just doesn't care for it."
"It works fine, my issue is the actual design of the game and the number placement. The numbers are not placed in the standard 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, then 0 at last line format. It’s in a two line format in order 0-4 then 5-9. Doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it does make it confusing for kids to find and push correct numbers."
Smaller than it appears. Slow. Not really user friendly for a kid. 
Not what I thought it was going to be like. Just wasn’t happy with it 
" My kids lost interest in this pretty fast. We are homeschoolers so, I have allot of different resources for them to practice with. They usually opt to do other practice. If you give them say 20 minutes a day to sit and specifically do this then it might be helpful but, it isn't that interesting for them. "
"My kid is in 2nd grade and he loves this. It has two levels. You can specify which number you would like to practice. For example, you pick “3” and practice multiplying by 3. You can turn the sound off or on. And you can turn the timer, “quiz” function off and kids can practice all the multiplication facts they want without having the pressure of a 60 second timer. I’m not sure why there are bad reviews. Maybe people didn’t read the directions? We got the Amazon warehouse deal. ;)"
