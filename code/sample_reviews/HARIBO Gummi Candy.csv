"Bought the 12 pack of Sour Gummies for my daughter who was extremely excited to get these, when we opened the first pack the gummies were hard as a rock and couldn’t even chew them, disappointed we opened up another bag… same thing.. all these bags were not able to be eaten.. a complete waste of my money. These must of been stored incorrectly prior to shipment which led to the poor quality! Very dissatisfied Customer !!"
"We all know how great Haribo gummy bears are. The flavors are really vibrant and there's no fake aftertaste... Delicious! But it's hard to recommend the sour gummy bears to anyone looking for a good sour candy because it's not that sour! These are less sour than Sour Patch Kids, and I'd place those pretty low on my sourness scale too. You can try these if you'd like, because they are still delicious. Just don't expect much in the sour department."
"I bought these because I was hoping they were the made in Germany Gummy Bears. They are not. The box I got was made in Turkey. They taste a little different, perhaps just a tad sweeter. They're not bad, but they are not was I was hoping for"
"Every bag inedible!! They were smashed together so you couldn't open the bag. It was as if something very, very heavy sat on the box for a very long time. Just threw in trash."
"Ordered this thinking it was a good deal, but the description of the product is wrong, you won’t get 24 packs, you will get 4 (2oz) packs which is definitely not a good deal. Don’t order. You won’t be able to return either."
Great price and most importantly they’re soft!! Many times I’ve purchased them at the store and they are old and hard. Never when I order from Amazon.
"There are only 4 bags of 57 g each. That comes out to more than $5 a small bag. It’s true, it is what the amazon page says, but previously the same item order and price gave me a box (at least 15) of same size bags. Not sure what’s going on."
Careless packaging to give me 20 boxes of Gummis that expire nearly immediately.
The contents were all bonded together into a blob. This is the first Tim I’ve encountered this problem. I’ve purchased this product multiple times in the past. I’m TOTALLY disappointed/dissatisfied with this purchase.
I love this Candy so much but I was very surprised when I open the box. And the candy was stuck together in the bag so I was not happy and could not eat it because it seem like it was sitting in a heated to Place. And they was stuck together. So sad I just throw them away.
