I want to let people know that this SSD was swapped. I ordered a 4 TB SSD. When I popped in the SSD the total capacity was less than 2 TB total. I wanted to use this SSD drive with the PS4 for more storage.,
"Two issues. First, I don't know what they expect users to do without mounting screws. I was lucky to find some that fit out of a junked pc. The 3.5"" drive I was replacing had larger mounting screws. The second, and MUCH MORE IMPORTANT issue is that my recovery partition D is missing now. Their migration software doesn't copy it. If I have problems in the future I am in real trouble. I did find instructions for how to manually copy the missing D drive over, they are complex and time consuming and I was about to start down that road when I thought a good first step might be to warn others. It would be ok if I had made a recovery disk before migrating, but samsung didn't mention I might need to, and I no longer have that option as they have lost my recovery partition. I suppose I could put the old hard drive in, make a recovery disk, and then put the SSD back in... grrrr",
"I am not very impressed with the 870 series at all. Just recently had one start to fail that wasn't in service for very long. Reading some of the bad reports on the internet about the 870's persuaded me to take this one off-line, and in the future, will only be used for test-bedding systems and software. 2",
I liked how easy the SSD Internal memory was to put in my gaming PC. The only flaw is I had to change the SSD with an old one that still had memory on it. Just make sure to get the right size so you can put it into the correct hardware bay. Very good for gaming. Stores games great!,
"These days, M2 is where it is at if you have the support for it, but for those older motherboards that do not have an M2 slot or won't work with an add-on M2 card, this is the next best thing. Not nearly as fast as the M2 drives, but still much faster than a spinning drive. Works the same as a traditional spinning drive, now replacing traditional spinning drives as the common sense baseline storage. Connects up via a sata cable. and will work without much fuss for a motherboard that supports SATA hard drives. The actual throughput you get depends on which level Sata interface your motherboard supports, typical is ~600MB/s .",
I  guess Samsung expects to anyone ordering this product to be above average when it comes to computer knowledge. That A'nit me. Don't get me wrong the Drive is great. I replace a 4 year old drive that came with my ASUS and I doubt I could have purchased a new computer that would compete with what I have now. My old computer will now stack up with any new computer I would have purchased.  I do have a minor complaint... I needed to buy screws and a usb to SATA cable to do the installation. The items were inexpensive but it would have been nice to know upfront as it would have made the process quicker.  But overall I am super happy with this product.,
"Leaving two stars because other people seem to like this product so maybe I just received a dud. I have set up two other ssds with no issues so I don’t believe it’s on my end but who knows. I connected the sata port then plugged in the ssd and then optimized it. The computer recognized it just fine at first but then when I started to move files over or downloading things on it, it then started disconnecting and reconnecting during any download. When I could finally move something or download something on it i would then receive a “disk error” message and the download wouldn’t complete. I checked bios and it says it’s active. I tried reconnecting and turning off the power supply to my computer and unplugging it and that didn’t fix it. Checked firmware updates for the SSD and it was already up to date. Even tried a different sata wire thinking maybe my wire was bad but that still didn’t fix it.",
"I  bought this drive partly because Samsung offers free data migration software which allows a running operating system to be copied from any other brand of drive onto a Samsung drive. Imagine my surprise when I tried to transfer my OS from this product, a 500 GB Samsung SSD, onto an older 1TB Samsung spinning drive. The software told me that I could not copy my OS onto the selected Samsung drive. Say what? Well, apparently, Samsung data migration software does not support discontinued Samsung products. In order to copy my OS onto my older 1TB Samsung drive, I would need to use the data migration software that was current at the time that my 1 TB drive was still in production. As one might guess, I do not have a copy of the older Samsung software, and Samsung does not offer prior/older versions on their web site. I'll keep the 500 GB SSD. It's an OK drive. But I regret purchasing it.",
"The website where the software is located is not intuitive, you will have to search a bit. As such. The cloning application fails at 99% completion with an unidentified error. This was on a later version of the operating system... yet on a much earlier version, which isn't suppose to be compatible (according to Samsung's documentstion ) but migrated flawlessly. A more through cleaning of the earlier OS may be necessary. Some hidden process , anti virus , firewall setting ect. , could be the issue.",
"Otherwise, over all, I am pleased with every aspect of the product.",
